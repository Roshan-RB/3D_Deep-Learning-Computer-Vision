# 3D Machine Learning Portfolio Project

Welcome to my 3D machine learning portfolio project! This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on point cloud semantic segmentation using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in 3D machine learning and point cloud analysis. Key components of the project include:

- Data preprocessing: Loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction from 3D point cloud data.
- Model training: Training machine learning models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, MLP) for semantic segmentation of point clouds.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics and visualizations.
- Results: Summary of findings and insights gained from the project.

## Motivation

As an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in spatial data analysis and machine learning, this project serves as a showcase of my skills and capabilities in the field. By demonstrating my ability to work with complex spatial datasets and apply advanced machine learning techniques, I aim to highlight my potential as a valuable asset in data-driven projects.
