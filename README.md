# Point_cloud- Semantic_segmentation


Welcome to my 3D Machine learning project! This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on point cloud semantic segmentation using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to explore 3D machine learning and point cloud analysis. Key components of the project include:

- Data preprocessing: Loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction from 3D point cloud data.
- Model training: Training machine learning models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, MLP) for semantic segmentation of point clouds.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics and visualizations.
- Results: Summary of findings and insights gained from the project.

## Motivation

With a keen interest in exploring point cloud data and segmentation, this project serves as an exploration of spatial data analysis and machine learning techniques. By following a blog tutorial and applying the concepts learned, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of working with complex spatial datasets and applying machine learning algorithms for segmentation tasks.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `point_cloud_semantic_segmentation.ipynb` to execute the code and reproduce the results.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:
- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
